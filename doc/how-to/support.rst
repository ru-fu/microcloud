How to get support

MicroCloud is not yet ready for production.

We recommend using the default channels for all snaps required to run MicroCloud.
These are:

* For MicroCloud: ``latest/[stable|candidate|edge]``
* For LXD: ``latest/[stable|candidate|edge]``
* For MicroCeph: ``quincy/[stable|candidate|edge]``
* For MicroOVN: ``22.03/[stable|candidate|edge]``

.. note::

   Currently, there is no LTS version of MicroCloud.

Support and community
---------------------

The following channels are available for you to interact with the MicroCloud community:

- You can file bug reports and feature requests as `GitHub issues`_.

Commercial support for MicroCloud is available through `Ubuntu Pro`_ (Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only) or full Ubuntu Pro).
The support will cover all LTS versions for five years starting from the day of the release.

See the full `Ubuntu Pro service description`_ for detailed information about what support Ubuntu Pro provides.
